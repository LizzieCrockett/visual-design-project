                    <p id="gif-description"> &bull; This GIF has been designed for use as a teaser for the project, in a
                        similar
                        use
                        case to a museum or gallery event. <br />
                        &bull; It was created and animated in Photoshop. <br />
                        &bull; From the <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621?hl=en-GB"
                            target="_blank">standard suggested sizes</a>, I chose the "large rectangle" 336x280 as I
                        needed it to be relatively square to display a portrait image, but not as tall as a 300x600 half
                        page. <br />
                        &bull; I
                        used the stylised image
                        created for Image 4, the Lely portrait (Image 1), and the logo in PNG format. <br />
                        &bull; I have used a lot
                        of
                        opacity tweens to create a smooth effect between frames. <br />
                        &bull; I experimented with more position
                        tweens, to "drop" words into the frame, for instance, but even with frames of 0.01 seconds,
                        they appeared too jerky for the style of the project. <br />
                        &bull; The typeface for the Virginia Woolf quote
                        is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/bell-mt" target="_blank">Bell
                            MT</a>. It contrasts with the typeface in the opening image, conveying a sense of modernity
                        to help bring the idea of Aphra Behn into a modern context. <br />
                        &bull; For the "playwright, poet, spy"
                        text, I
                        chose a
                        typewriter-style font, <a href="https://www.dafont.com/jmh-typewriter.font" target="_blank">JMH
                            Typewriter</a>, to create a similar effect as in Image 6. In addition, typewriter-style
                        typefaces to me convey a sense of spy stories, so this adds to the
                        effect).<br />
                        &bull;
                        Rather than use black for the background, I chose <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigengrau" target="_blank">Eigengrau</a>, #16161D, as it
                        is a little less harsh on the eye
                        than complete black. <br />
                        &bull; The GIF is saved for web with 256 colours, as the painting requires retaining as
                        many
                        colours as possible.
