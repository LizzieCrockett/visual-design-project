            <h1>Animated GIF</h1>
            <img src="gif/Aphra-Behn-animated-gif.gif" />
            <p>This gif was created and animated in Photoshop. I chose the “large rectangle” 336x280 size as I would be
                using a portrait image so I needed it to be relatively square, but not as tall as a 300x600 half page. I have used the stylised image
                created for Image 4, the Lely portrait (Image 1), and the logo in PNG format. I have used a lot of
                opacity tweens to create a smooth effect between frames. I experimented with more position tweens, but
                they appeared too jerky for the style of the project. The typeface for the Virginia Woolf quote is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/bell-mt" target="_blank">Bell
                MT</a>, which helps create a sort of “classical” feel. For the “playwright, poet, spy” teaser, I chose another
                typewriter-style font, <a href="https://www.dafont.com/jmh-typewriter.font" target="_blank">JMH Typewriter</a>, to create the same effect as in Image 6 (and also in this
                context, typewriter-style typefaces to me convey a sense of spy stories, so adding to the effect). Rather
                than use black for the background, I chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigengrau" target="_blank">Eigengrau</a>, #16161D, as it is a little less harsh on the eye
                than complete black. It is saved for web with 256 colours, as the painting requires retaining as many
                colours as possible. The gif has been designed for use as a teaser for the project, in a similar use
                case to a museum or gallery event.
