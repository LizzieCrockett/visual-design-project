                <h1>Image 1</h1>
                <p>&bull; This is a portrait of Aphra Behn by Sir Peter Lely, which I edited in Photoshop. <br />
                    &bull; I wanted it for the background image of my site, so I resized it to 3262x2732 so that the
                    face
                    would be in the correct proportion on the page. <br />
                    &bull; It is a photograph of a painting, and has a somewhat faded appearance - I have never seen the
                    original
                    painting so don’t know if this fading is on the painting or the photo. <br />
                    &bull; In order to subtly remove this faded and washed-out effect, I brought the brightness down to
                    -5 from
                    original, and the contrast up +25. <br />
                    &bull; To further freshen the image, I adjusted the colour balance in the highlights 15 points from
                    cyan to
                    red, creating a rosier tint. <br />
                    &bull; The number of colours and extensive colour gradations in this image meant it made sense to
                    save it
                    as a jpg. <br />
                    &bull; When saving for web, I opted for medium quality. The quality of the
                    image needed to be balanced against its very large size, but the grainy nature of the oil painting
                    meant
                    crispness wasn’t a big problem, and the image only began to lose detail when quality was set to low.

                <h1>Image 2</h1>
                <p>&bull; This is a photograph of Aphra Behn’s grave in Westminster Abbey, which I edited in Photoshop.
                    <br />
                    &bull; Its intended use is as a 16:9 image (576x324) in a modular
                    content box on the website.
                    <br />
                    &bull; Under different circumstances, I would have gone to Westminster Abbey and
                    taken a photo in better lighting. However, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, this was not possible, so I
                    used
                    this as a challenge to optimise the image I have to the best of my ability. <br />
                    &bull; The image contains a lot of detail I didn’t need, and I wanted to focus on the
                    meaningful content, which in this context was the text on the grave. <br />
                    &bull; I first used the Crop tool to
                    select a 16:9 ratio (which framed the text details beautifully). <br />
                    &bull; I then straightened it in the Crop tool, and resized it to 576x324. <br />
                    &bull; Reducing the brightness by 10
                    and
                    increasing the contrast by 10 brought out the letters into sharper detail. <br />
                    &bull; Colour adjustment in the
                    midtones of 25 points from yellow to blue introduced a slightly cooler wash. <br />
                    &bull; To reduce the glare on
                    the
                    bottom right-hand corner, I masked the image and did a targeted curves adjustment in that corner.
                    <br />
                    &bull; I
                    then
                    used the Clone Stamp tool to remove the scuff between the words "Aphra" and "April". <br />
                    &bull; Finally, I
                    applied
                    a black and white filter, as I felt this sharpened the effect and made the image more striking.
                    <br />
                    &bull; It
                    was
                    saved for web as jpg, as with the original image. The small size of the image could be balanced
                    against the
                    quality. In this case it was important to retain as much quality as possible due to the image being
                    not ideal in
                    the
                    first place. At medium quality, the finer details of the lettering (especially the 9 in "1689")
                    became a
                    little less clear, but no noticeable improvement was gained at maximum quality, so I opted to save
                    it at
                    high quality.</p>

                <h1>Image 3</h1>
                <p> &bull; This is an image of some English civil war-era propaganda, which I sourced as a 500x306 png.
                    <br />
                    &bull;
                    Its
                    intended
                    use was in a 16:9, 576x324 content box, as with Image 2. <br />
                    &bull; When enlarging the original image, there is some blurring
                    and
                    pixelation on the lines, and there is also what looks like a faint watermark across the centre of
                    the
                    image. <br />
                    &bull; I used Illustrator to edit this image as I wanted to use the Image Trace
                    tool
                    to sharpen the lines and create more of a "woodcut" effect. <br />
                    &bull; I used Black and White Image Trace mode with paths
                    and
                    corners set to maximum and noise set to minimum to create this effect.<br />
                    &bull; Since Image Trace can also
                    render
                    a transparent background, I was also able to remove the watermark and insert a plain white
                    background.<br />
                    &bull; I
                    would say the resulting image has a different effect to the original, as opposed to being an
                    improvement
                    upon it.<br />
                    &bull; I saved it for web in PNG-8, as it is a graphic drawing. It is black and white, so few
                    colours
                    are required, and it only began to lose quality when selecting fewer than 8 colours. <br />
                    &bull; I then cropped
                    the
                    image in Photoshop and resized to 576x324 for use on the site.</p>

                <h1>Image 4</h1>
                <p>&bull; This is a photo of an edition of Aphra Behn’s published works. I liked the
                    wording
                    and
                    wanted to use it, but in a stylised form. <br />
                    &bull; I edited the image in Photoshop and then Illustrator to
                    achieve the effects I wanted. <br />
                    &bull; Initially I cropped the image to only contain the title text, and
                    straightened it. <br />
                    &bull; I then raised the contrast to 100 to sharpen the image. <br />
                    &bull; I reduced the
                    yellowed effect on the paper by making a colour adjustment, moving yellow 20 points to blue. <br />
                    &bull; I then
                    used
                    the Clone Stamp tool to remove the stained marks on the paper. The image at this intermediate stage
                    can be seen below. <br />
                    &bull;
                    I then used the Image Trace tool in Illustrator, using 3 Colours mode to create the cartoonish,
                    stylised effect.<br />
                    &bull; It was saved for web as a PNG-8 wth 4 colour setting - since the Image Trace had
                    reduced it to three colours, there was no loss of quality in using minimal colours.

                    other locations as needed. <br />
                    &bull; I created it in Illustrator. <br />

                    IM
                    Fell Double Pica SC (for uppercase), in keeping with the choice made for the website mock-ups.
                    <br />

                    layout
                    of the letters, I made them separate elements and repositioned them. <br />

                    the

                    &bull; To ensure the text displayed correctly on devices without the font IM Fell installed, when exporting I used the option Convert to Outline, to ensure it was processed as an image rather than text. <br />

                <h1>Image 6</h1>
                <p>&bull;  This image was inspired by a quote from Germaine Greer. In saying we know almost nothing about Behn's
                    private life, she described her as "a palimpsest; she has scratched herself out." This
                    conveyed a very powerful visual image to me, so I created this image in Photoshop to reflect
                    it.<br />
                    &bull; The
                    source image is an engraving of a portrait by Mary Beale, and is very small at 400x320.<br />
                    &bull; To make the
                    light and dark parts "pop" more and make the image less faded, I reduced the brightness by -20 and
                    increased the contrast by +50. <br />
                    &bull; I then altered the colour of the grey pixels to create a richer, inky blue
                    effect.<br />
                    &bull; I created the scratch effect using the Paint tool with a 1px
                    brush
                    on a hard round setting. I experimented with black and various shades of grey, but white was the
                    most
                    striking effect. <br />
                    &bull; The phrase "scratched herself out" suggests a frenetic or impulsive mood, so I wanted
                    the
                    text to appear slightly irregular on the image - the words are not laid out to align perfectly.
                    <br />
                    &bull; I
                    experimented with breaking up the word "scratched" into "scr atch ed" and scattering it across the
                    page, but this made
                    the
                    effect too random, so I kept it as one word. <br />
                    &bull; I chose a typewriter-style typeface, <a
                        href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite" target="_blank">Special Elite</a>, for
                    the main text, as it
                    conveys a continuity with a modern idea of being a writer, thus placing Behn in a more modern
                    context. <br />
                    &bull; It took me a long time to find the
                    right typeface for "scratched." I experimented with a number of rough cursive-style fonts, but no
                    matter
                    how sharp-edged, they always seemed too "friendly" for the effect I wanted to convey. Unexpectedly,
                    a
                    plainer,
                    more open sans-serif typeface worked best. I ultimately settled on <a
                        href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gruppo" target="_blank"> Gruppo</a>.<br />
                    &bull;
                    The image is an engraving and does not have a great deal of colour gradation, so I saved it for web
                    as a
                    PNG-8. I opted for 64 colours, as below this, the image began to lose colours.
