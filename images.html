            </div>
            <p>This is a portrait of Aphra Behn by Sir Peter Lely. The original is 1608x1920, already a large file. I
                edited it in Photoshop. Because I wanted it for the background image of my site, I opted to resize it
                even larger, to 3262x2732, so that the face would be in the correct proportion on the page.
                It is a photograph of a painting, and has a somewhat faded appearance - I have never seen the original
                painting so don’t know if this fading is on the painting or the photo. In order to subtly remove this
                faded and washed-out effect, I brought the brightness down to -5 from original, and the contrast up +25.
                To further freshen the image, I adjusted the colour balance in the highlights 15 points from cyan to
                red, creating a rosier tint. The number of colours and extensive colour gradations in this image meant
                it made sense to save it as a jpg. When saving for web, I opted for medium quality. The quality of the
                image needed to be balanced against its very large size, but the grainy nature of the oil painting meant
                crispness wasn’t a big problem, and the image only began to lose detail when quality was set to low.

            <p>This is a photograph of Aphra Behn’s grave in Westminster Abbey. The original image is very large at
                4032x3024. I edited it in Photoshop. Its intended use is as a 16:9 image (576x324) in a modular content
                box on the website. The image contains a lot of detail I didn’t need, and I wanted to focus on the
                meaningful content, which in this context was the text on the grave. I first used the Crop tool to
                select a 16:9 ratio (which framed the text details beautifully), straightened it in the Crop tool, then
                resized it to 576x324. Under different circumstances, I would have gone to Westminster Abbey and taken a
                photo in better lighting. However, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, this was not possible, so I used this
                as a challenge to optimise the image I have to the best of my ability. Reducing the brightness by 10 and
                increasing the contrast by 10 brought out the letters into sharper detail. Colour adjustment in the
                midtones of 25 points from yellow to blue introduced a slightly cooler wash. To reduce the glare on the
                bottom right-hand corner, I masked the image and did a targeted curves adjustment in that corner. I then
                used the Clone Stamp tool to remove the scuff between the words “Aphra" and “April". Finally, I applied
                a black and white filter, as I felt this sharpened the effect and made the image more striking. It was
                saved as jpg, as with the original image. The small size of the image could be balanced against the
                quality. It was important to retain as much quality as possible due to the image being not ideal in the
                first place. At medium quality, the finer details of the lettering (especially the 9 in “1689") became a
                little less clear, but no noticeable improvement was gained at maximum quality, so I opted to save it at
                high quality.</p>

            <p>This is an image of some English civil war-era propaganda. It was sourced as a 500x306 png. Its intended
                use was in a content box, as with image 2. When enlarging the original image, there is some blurring and
                pixelation on the lines, and there is also what looks like a faint watermark across the centre of the
                image (this makes me wonder about its presence on Wikimedia Commons, but I was unable to find a version
                of the image elsewhere). I used Illustrator to edit this image as I wanted to use the Image Trace tool
                to sharpen the lines and create more of a “woodcut" effect. I used Black and White mode with paths and
                corners set to maximum and noise set to minimum to create this effect. Since Image Trace can also render
                a transparent background, I was also able to remove the watermark and insert a plain white background. I
                would say the resulting image has a different effect to the original, as opposed to being an improvement
                upon it. I saved it for web in PNG-8, as it is a graphic drawing. It is black and white, so few colours
                are required, and it only began to lose quality when selecting fewer than 8 colours. I then cropped the
                image and resized to 576x324 for use on the site.</p>

            <p>This image was originally a photo of the cover of Aphra Behn’s published works. I liked the wording and
                wanted to use it, but in a stylised form. I edited the image in Photoshop and then Illustrator to
                achieve the effects I wanted. Initially I cropped the image to only contain the title text, and
                straightened it. I then raised the contrast to 100 to sharpen the image. I slightly by reduced the
                yellowed effect on the paper by making a colour adjustment, moving yellow 20 points to blue. I also used
                the clone stamp to remove the stained marks on the paper. The intermediate image can be seen here.
                I then used the Image Trace tool in Illustrator with the 3 Colours mode to create the cartoonish,
                stylised effect. It was saved for web as a PNG-8 wth 4 colour setting - since the image trace had
                reduced it to three colours, there was no loss of quality.

            <p>This is a logo for the whole project, designed to be used as a splash loading page on the website, and in
                other locations as needed. I created it in Illustrator. The typeface used is IM Fell Double Pica and IM
                Fell Double Pica SC, in keeping with the choice made for the website. To create the very specific layout
                of the letters, I made them separate elements. I also wanted the letter A to have a vertical line on the
                right, and I achieved this by using the Shear tool to manipulate its shape. I also made a favicon for
                the website with a monogram “AB" using the same sheared A. </p>

            </div>
            <p>This image was inspired by a quote from Germaine Greer talking about how we know almost nothing about
                Aphra Behn’s private life. She described her as “a palimpsest; she has scratched herself out." This
                conveyed a very powerful visual image to me, so I created this image in Photoshop to reflect it. The
                source image is an engraving of a portrait by Mary Beale, and is very small at 400x320. To make the
                light and dark parts “pop" more and make the image less faded, I reduced the brightness by -20 and
                increased the contrast by +50. I then created the scratch effect using the Paint tool with a 1px brush
                on a hard round setting. I experimented with black and various shades of grey, but white was the most
                striking effect. The phrase “scratched herself out" suggests a certain frenetic mood, so I wanted the
                text to appear slightly irregular on the image - they are not laid out to align perfectly. I
                experimented with breaking up the word “scratched" and scattering it across the page, but this made the
                effect too random so I stuck with one word. I chose a typewriter-style typeface, <a
                    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite" target="_blank">Special Elite </a> as it
                conveys to me the
                idea of being a writer, and places her in a more modern context. It took me a long time to find the
                right typeface for “scratched." I experimented with a number of rough cursive-style fonts, but no matter
                how sharp-edged, they always seemed too “friendly" for the effect I wanted to convey. Somehow a plainer,
                more open typeface worked better. I ultimately settled on <a
                    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gruppo" target="_blank"> Gruppo </a>.
                The image is an engraving and does not have a great deal of colour gradation, so I saved it for web as a
                PNG-8. I opted for 64 colours, as below this, the image began to lose colours.
