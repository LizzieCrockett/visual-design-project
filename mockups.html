            <p id="mockup-intro">This site is a content source which serves as online support for a schools immersive
                theatre project (for
                Key Stage 3, students aged 11-14) about the playwright Aphra Behn. <br />
                I wanted the site to retain an identity as a digital space while at the same time conveying a strong
                sense of the world of 17th century theatre. In keeping with the visual style we associate
                with Restoration-era England, I wanted the space to convey visual cues of sensuousness and extravagance.
                Achieving a strong sense of place also helps back up the immersive theatre work the site is supporting.
                However, I also wanted to keep the space clean and without unnecessary embellishment. This required a
                certain amount of compromise, design-wise. <br />
                I used the Lely portrait as a background image because I felt
                this image provided just that sense of sumptuousness, while still being a single detail and not
                overcomplicating the space. <br /> The mockups were created in Photoshop using artboards on the Web Most
                Common
                preset (1366x768). <br />I was delighted to find the ideal typeface to convey the historical period in
                <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IM+Fell+Double+Pica?query=IM+Fell#about" target="_blank">IM
                    Fell Double Pica
                </a>(with IM Fell Double Pica SC for uppercase text). It is a direct replica of a 1680s typeface. When
                selecting a typeface for educational purposes, readability was if anything even more important than it
                would
                be normally. There are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=IM+Fell" target="_blank">a number of
                    variants of IM
                    Fell</a>, but I felt Double Pica was the one which conveyed the best readability due to the greatest
                regularity between the letters. </p>

            <p>The homepage of the site is the main display for the portrait of Aphra Behn which serves as a background
                for the entire site. <br />The Acts are menu links. <br />The layout is inspired by <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/search?q=17th+century+playbills&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB789GB789&sxsrf=ALeKk029tMyOf9_-Z2yIsPkdpup1BOuyxA:1594645842513&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiV5_DXpsrqAhXPX8AKHbl4AfEQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw&biw=1396&bih=657"
                    target="_blank">17th
                    century playbills</a> (with compromises for readability and accessibility). <br />I wanted to
                include a
                hint of the quirks of
                printing at this time - the mixing of uppercase, capitalisation and sentence case. <br />This layout and
                choice of typeface again aims to convey a strong sense of place and time. </p>

            <p>This page is a static source of biographical content, and displays modular boxes with 16:9 images and
                around 125 words of text. <br />I decided on this layout after doing heuristic evaluations of other
                educational sites aimed at Key Stage 3. <br />I feel it breaks the information down into easily
                digestible
                chunks. <br />I chose the typeface <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/ABeeZee?query=ABeeZee"
                    target="_blank">ABeeZee</a> as the best solution for
                readability, bearing in mind the
                educational content and the wide range of abilities catered for in this content. This typeface is
                specifically designed with readability for children in mind.</p>

            <p>This is a secondary menu page. <br />It aims to echo the “playbill” theme on the homepage. <br /> In
                order to differentiate
                it from that, I placed the menu on an off-white background to convey a printed page.</p>

            <p>This layout was also chosen as a result of heuristic evaluation of educational sites. <br />I chose to
                include
                a character menu under the nav to increase usability and ease of switching between different pages. </p>
