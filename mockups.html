            <p id="mockup-intro">&bull; This site is a content source which serves as online support for a schools
                immersive
                theatre project (for
                Key Stage 3, students aged 11-14) about the playwright Aphra Behn. <br />
                &bull; I wanted the site to retain an identity as a digital space while at the same time conveying a
                strong
                sense of the world of 17th century theatre. In keeping with the visual style we associate
                with Restoration-era England, I wanted the space to convey visual cues of sensuousness and extravagance.
                Achieving a strong sense of place also helps back up the immersive theatre work the site is supporting.
                However, I also wanted to keep the space clean and without unnecessary embellishment. This required a
                certain amount of compromise, design-wise. <br />
                &bull; I used the Lely portrait (see Image 1) as a background image because I felt
                its rich tones provided the right sense of sumptuousness, while still being a single detail and not
                overcomplicating the space with overdecoration. <br /> &bull; These mockups were created in Photoshop
                using artboards on the Web Most
                Common
                preset (1366x768). <br /> &bull; When
                selecting a typeface for educational purposes, readability was if anything even more important than it
                would
                be normally. I was delighted to find the ideal typeface to convey the historical period in
                <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IM+Fell+Double+Pica?query=IM+Fell#about" target="_blank">IM
                    Fell Double Pica
                </a>(with IM Fell Double Pica SC for uppercase text), which is a direct replica of a 1680s typeface.
                There are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=IM+Fell" target="_blank">a number of
                    variants of IM
                    Fell</a>, but I felt Double Pica was the one which conveyed the best readability, as it has the most
                regularity between letterforms. </p>

                <h1>Mock-up 1 - Homepage</h1>
                <p>&bull; The homepage of the site is the main display for the portrait of Aphra Behn which serves as a
                    background
                    for the entire site. <br />&bull; The Acts are menu links. <br /> &bull; The layout is inspired by
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=17th+century+playbills&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB789GB789&sxsrf=ALeKk029tMyOf9_-Z2yIsPkdpup1BOuyxA:1594645842513&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiV5_DXpsrqAhXPX8AKHbl4AfEQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw&biw=1396&bih=657"

                    wanted to
                    include a
                    hint of the quirks of
                    printing at this time - the mixing of uppercase, capitalisation and sentence case. <br />This layout
                    and
                    choice of typeface again aims to convey a strong sense of place and time. </p>

                <h1>Mock-up 2 - Times page</h1>
                <p>&bull; This page is a static source of biographical content, and displays modular boxes with 16:9
                    images and
                    around 125 words of text. <br /> &bull; I decided on this layout after doing heuristic evaluations
                    of other
                    educational sites aimed at Key Stage 3. <br />&bull; I feel it breaks the information down into
                    easily
                    digestible
                    chunks. <br />&bull; I chose the typeface <a
                        href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/ABeeZee?query=ABeeZee" target="_blank">ABeeZee</a> as
                    the best solution for
                    readability, bearing in mind the
                    educational content and the wide range of abilities catered for in this content. This typeface is
                    specifically designed with readability for children in mind.</p>

                <p>&bull; This is a secondary menu page providing links to a series of videos. <br />&bull; It aims to
                    echo the "playbill" theme on the
                    homepage. <br /> &bull; In
                    order to differentiate
                    it from that, I placed the menu on an off-white background to convey a printed page.</p>
